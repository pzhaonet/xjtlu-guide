XJTLU IMPRINT launches a Call for proposal for publications. The proposals of publications may include (but are not limited to):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Original research monographs
\item
  Edited volumes
\item
  Journals
\item
  Conference Proceedings\\
\item
  Textbooks
\item
  Translations of impactful Chinese academic works into English
\item
  Translations of impactful English academic works into Chinese
\item
  Bilingual articles\\
\item
  Creative works, e.g.~screenplays
\end{itemize}

All submissions will be subject to internal and external review.

XJTLU IMPRINT will seek to prioritise work that either speaks to the theme of intercultural exchange, that widens the reach of research in the areas of Humanities, Sciences, Technologies, and Social Sciences by being presented in a bilingual format, or that takes an innovative pedagogical perspective appropriate to a global context.
